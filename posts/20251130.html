        <h3>The World has changed</h3>
<p>
    There’s been a change. A shift. We can all feel it. Perhaps the under 20’s can’t because life for them is full of constant change but I’m in my mid 40’s and it’s as clear as day to me. The future is not going to look remotely close to the past. If you go back a few hundred years, your life would be very similar to your grandparents. The things your grandfather told you would be not just wise but also useful and relevent to your own life. That joinery trick he picked up, is going to help you too. This hasn't been the case for the last 100 years, but for this generation it's now extreme. The world has changed.

<p>
    The first time you use AI it’s quite a shocking experience, especially if you get an answer that you know is better than you could have given yourself. It’s surprising, mind-blowing even, when you realise human intelligence has a competitor. If NASA spotted a ship steering towards Earth and broadcast out to us all that in 3 years we’ll be meeting non-human intelligence, what would happen? How would we prepare? Would some of us set up an awesome greeting show 10x what we do for super bowl half time, with the worlds best singers and light shows? Would we step up weaponry capabilities and our encryption technology and build underground bunkers? Would we set up a moon base? Would the economy boom or would chaos and uncertainty occur? All of the above probably.<br>
    Reality check&hellip; Non-human intelligence is arriving on Earth, NASA didn’t broadcast it, but it’s been broadcast nonetheless by the likes of Google and OpenAI.
    <em>What are you doing about it?</em><br>
    I’ll tell you what I’m doing? I’m accumulating DIEM. DIEM is a communication channel you’re going to need. DIEM is a utility asset that everyone should be accumulating.

<p>
    Even if the raw intelligence of our machines doesn’t improve, the soil is already fertile enough for years of tech advancements. In my opinion, we have hardly scratched the surface of what we can do with LLMs. One side of things are the products and services that are going to get significantly better. Another side of things are the agents that are going to do things on our behalf. Software with <em>agency</em>, acting for us. I’m imagining having armies of digital twins existing in the digital realm aiming to do things that align with our goals. While we do our day job, bots are going to spawn in the background to fact check that email you just drafted, or suggest a better background for that slide your working on, or research the price action of that ticker you just mentioned in a Slack chat, or put together a holiday package for that city your WhatApp Group are talking about. Your ability to access and command AI is going to be your edge. The more AI capability you have, the more stuff you’re going to be able to do. There’s going to be a parallel internet abuzz with agents chattering and bartering with each other all on quests and sub-quests. Your agents are going to build and evolve custom software purpose built for you and the way you do things. I don’t think there will be an App store so much as the App you want or need will be built in real-time for you, probably stitching together various protocols. But I don’t think it’ll be called, or thought of as an App. I think it’ll be thought of as part of your personal AI. I wonder if everyones hardware devices are going to run an Operating System tailored for them acting as your gateway to a mesh network of AIs.

<p>
    Things are going to get crazy.

<p>
    In my opinion the potential of AI hasn’t been unlocked yet. Not even close. Accumulate, not for now, but for what will be.

        <h3>Some DIEM Targets</h3>

<p>
    Your first target is 24 DIEM. Then you’ll have enough to spend $1 per hour, every hour.<br>
    If you amass 86.4 DIEM you can access 1c of AI per 10s.<br>
    With 144 DIEM you can spend 10c per minute.<br>
    The minimum wage in America is $7.25 per hour federally. To pay that, you need 174 DIEM.<br>
    With 240 DIEM you can spend $10 per hour. Now we’re getting somewhere. I wonder how many parallel agents you’re going to be able to command spending $10 per hour?<br>
    With 864 DIEM, you can spend 1c per second. But that’ll cost you $100k at todays prices, out of reach by everyone listening to this podcast.

        <h3>Why DIEM?</h3>

<p>
    I think Venice have put it perfectly in <a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xbb345d35450bf9ee76f3d2ce214e8e7ac5e1071d">the description box of Dexscreener</a>:

<blockquote>
    &gt; DIEM transforms AI compute from a service you rent into an onchain asset you own: tokenized intelligence. Each Diem token represents $1 per day of Venice API capacity that never expires and never changes value.<br>
    DIEM are ERC20 tokens on Base and can be transferred, traded, and staked. DIEM can only be minted by locking staked VVV (sVVV), making DIEM and VVV a foundational assets for onchain AI.<br>
    Tokenizing intelligence with DIEM creates new possibilities:
    <ul>
    <li>Developers/agents: 1 DIEM = $1/day Venice API access, forever
    <li>VVV holders: Monetize unused compute as DIEM → earn yield → buy back later to unlock VVV
    <li>Apps: Fixed AI costs, guaranteed capacity, no variable API bills
    <li>Onchain economy: Agents own their intelligence, DeFi collateralizes compute
    </ul>
&gt; Minting DIEM with VVV creates a brand-new onchain building block for AI - programmable, composable compute.
</blockquote>

<p>
    It’s such a good description of DIEM!

<p>
    Buying DIEM is like buying a lifetime subscription to a little piece of AI. The more DIEM you buy, the bigger the piece of AI at your mercy. If Tether ($USDT) is stable money, then $DIEM is stable AI thinking time. Always $1/day of API credit, no matter what. That’s how Venice turns AI into an asset you can truly own.

<p>
    Do you think the usage of AI is going away, or do you think it’s usage is going to grow?<br>
    When is the best time to buy a lifetime subscription? The DIEM concept hasn’t caught on yet. Get the allocation you want before it does!

<p>
    Buy DIEM, HODL it. See the AI ecosystem unfold and enjoy knowing you have a participation ticket.
