        <h3>The Venice Mobile App</h3>
        <p>
        The Venice AI team is cooking. There’s a new “Venice AI” Mobile App in the App store now which I’m excited about. There's certain things the team can do with a Mobile App that is much harder to do with a Website.
        I’m hopeful to be able to have a voice to voice conversation with Venice on my phone one-day. Voice is something that's going to be much more achieveable on a Device, rather than a website.
        Another feature of Mobile Apps is Notifications. I wonder what the Venice team can do with Notifications?
        Perhaps one day in the future, we'll be able to Ask Venice to check what birthdays are coming up for close family members and get it to send a list of good gift ideas 3 weeks beforehand. A Notification or Email would be good for that.
        Or maybe I want to buy a Google Pixel phone but my budget is £800. Maybe I could ask Venice to keep an eye on prices and notify me if it finds a deal within my price range.
        This is the kind of stuff a Mobile App (together with out technology, e.g. long running background agents) could enable in the future.

        <h3>DIEM is launching soon</h3>
        <p>
        And DIEM is launching in <time datetime="2025-08-20">4 days time</time> (on Wednesday 20th August). The launch should be exciting. For me it marks a new epoch of Venice history and I wanted to start a VLOG before it occurred.

        <h3>Why do I like the Venice Token?</h3>

        <p>
        I want to own a productive asset. I’m speculating that Access to Artificial intelligence is going to be a productive asset.

        <p>
        AI is going to change the world profoundly and I believe we have about 3 years before working a normal Job is impossible.
        VVV is my ticket out of becoming the permanent underclass.
        I'm planning to put as much energy as I can into acquiring Venice Tokens because if private and decentralised AI is a useful resource in the future, I'll be sorted and if it is not a useful resource, well good, because I guess it means I'm not living in the dystopia I’m worried about.
        So I win either way.
